			<p class="info">For over 80 years, Vic's Vending Machines has been producing handmade, top quality vending machines for 
			businesses, venues, offices, and vending machine lovers alike. In 1933 in his New York City home, Victor "Vic" Wigglesworth
			created his very first prototype of a vending machine. Vic promptly sold it to a local pet shop, who filled
			the vending machine with animal food. That pet shop today? Petco. From there, Vic only continued to look forward,
			making vending machines of many varieties, innovating design, security, and features along the way. </br></br>Today,
			Vic's Vending Machines is a family business based in New York City, still persisting with the high quality Vic established
			this company off of.</p>
